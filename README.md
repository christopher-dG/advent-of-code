Follow my associated blog posts [here](https://cdg.dev/tags/aoc)!

### Goals

- Learning OCaml
- Fun

### Non-Goals

- Optimality of solutions
- Speed of programming

### Personal Rules

- Avoid excessive external packages
- Avoid finding help online
- Don't go back and refactor old solutions (leaving comments is okay, I want to be able to see my progression)

### Cheat Days

### Run It

```sh
dune runtest  # Tests
dune exec bench/main.exe -quota 1  # Benchmarks
```
