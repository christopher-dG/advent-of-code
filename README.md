### Cheat Days

- Day 5: Used the `combination` package to compute permutations of a list.
- Day 10: Searched around for ways to compute the points that lie between two other points.

- Dau 12: "Accidentally" saw a Reddit post that revealed the strategy.

### Run It

Test all solutions with `mix test`.
